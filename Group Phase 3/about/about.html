  <h3>MISSION</h3>
  <p>Soup Surreal is committed to serving fresh soups made with in-season, local ingredients!
    Our incredible Chef Derek has recently adapted the Slow Food technique that requires lots of time and patience to bring out all the best flavours and aromas.
    We offer a variety of soups for everyone including vegetarian, dairy and gluten-free options! Look for the special V, DF and GF symbols on our
     <a href="../menu/menu.html">Menu Page</a>
  </p>

  <p>While we rotate our menu daily, your favourites will always still be available in our freezer for you to enjoy in any of our choice of sizes.
    Located in Stratford, we love building connections with our local community!
    In past years, we have been honoured to receive the People’s Choice Award twice, as well as the 2015 Business Excellence Award!

  <h3>CHEF DEREK</h3>

  <h3>SLOW FOODS</h3>
  <p>The addition of Slow Food has changed the way Soup Surreal plans their recipes, chooses their recipes and inspired lifestyle changes in Chef Derek since joining Slow Food in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>For Soup Surreal, making our soups is simply us cooking from the heart using classic techniques and gastronomy theory.
     Soup stocks are the “fonds de cuisine” or “the very foundation of the classic kitchen”; and the quality of the base used for soups and sauces is the most beautiful and important component of cooking.
  </p>
  <p>Soup Surreal's beef stock is made with fresh bones of local corn fed beef, Niagara red wine, local vegetables, herbs, as well as local tomato paste; the nutrients and flavours are drawn out of the ingredients slowly over the 24-hour cooking period.
    The result is an incredibly rich and deep natural flavour showcasing the quality of local produce and meat at our fingertips.
  </p>
  <p>Tasting the results from the combination of incredibly flavourful local ingredients prepared and cooked with patience and proper practices, fills the mind and soul with great pride for what we can create from our own community.
    We must strive to source and enjoy everything that our local community has to offer.
  </p>
  <p>Soup Surreal will continue its quest to make soups that are “good”, “clean” and “fair”. We encourage you to learn more about slow food and enjoy the wonderful results.
  </p>
  <p>Stand up for your community, one ingredient at a time.
